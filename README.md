# SwiftConcurrency
This project is an example of how to use concurrency in Swift to improve the performance of an app that performs a lot of network requests. The app uses the URLSession API to fetch data from a remote API and display it in the user interface.

## Features
+ Uses URLSession and the async/await syntax to perform asynchronous network requests.
+ Utilizes DispatchQueue to perform tasks concurrently in the background, improving app performance.
+ Implements a simple user interface to display the fetched data.

## Usage
+ Launch the app on your device or simulator.
+ The app will fetch data from a remote API and display it in a table view.
+ You can tap on a table view cell to see more details about the fetched data.
